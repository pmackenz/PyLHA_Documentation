Example 1: SPT profile
-----------------------

Site location information

1.  Site location can be entered through the **Site Location** module by

    - entering numeric coordinates, or
    - selecting a location by mouse click on the interactive map.
      (This requires checking the option above the map view.)

2.  Alternatively, the site information will be set accordingly when loading a
    pre-computed hazard data set in the **Hazard** module.

Soil profile definition

* soil profiles are entered through import from a formatted Excel spread sheet.
  (The provided templates need to be used.)  Go to the **Soil Profile** module and click the **Load Soil Profile** button to load your soil data.

   Two demo profiles have been installed with the software.  They can be found in :code:`Users\\YOUR_USER\\Documents\\PyLHA\\SoilProfiles`.
   That folder is also the recommended location to store your profile definition files.

A successful import will show the provided data in a table and as a visual representation.

The **Hazard** module is restricted to pre-computed hazard data (:math:`\beta`-version only) and will direct you to the selection interface.  Four demo profiles were installed with this software.
They can be found in :code:`Users\\YOUR_USER\\Documents\\PyLHA\\ExistingHazardData`.
In the production release, any hazard data computed will be stored in that folder for efficient computations for this or nearby sites.

You may see the following dialog warning about a non-matching location for the pre-computed hazard data.

This dialog will change in the final release when site specific hazard data can be downloaded from the USGS web interface and processed on your computer.
In the meantime, please accept the shift in the site location.

Running a `Single Scenario Triggering` analysis for this soil profile.
(Other triggering scenarios will be shown in **Example 2: CPT profile**)

* make your selections for the single scenario
* click the **COMPUTE** button. (There may be a short delay while the analysis runs.)
* Results appear in plots once computed.
  (All plots can be exported to PNG or PDF files or copied to the ClipBoard and pasted into, e.g., Word)

* All results are also available in numeric form in a tab behind the plots.
  (numeric data can be exported to Excel through the **Report** module)
