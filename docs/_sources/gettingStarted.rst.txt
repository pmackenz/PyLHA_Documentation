Getting started
==========================

* install the software using the provided installer.  This will install the application and a custom python environment.
* On the first run of `PyLHA`:
   - allow for extra startup time since the application is setting up a work folder with demo data files.
   - depending on your display, the font size may not suit your needs.  If so, go to `Help -> Change Font Size` (or press `Ctrl-Y`) to open a font selection dialog.
